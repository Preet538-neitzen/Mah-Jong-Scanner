## Introduction

The Low Vision Mah Jong Scanner is a web application (mobile compatible) designed to make playing the game of Mah Jong accessible to individuals who are blind or have very low vision. This project leverages QR codes and audio feedback to provide a user-friendly experience.

### Key Features

- Scan Mah Jong Tiles with QR Codes
- Get Audible Tile Descriptions
- Learn about Mah Jong Point Systems
- Simple User Interface with Three Large Buttons

## How It Works

Every Mah Jong tile is equipped with a unique QR code on its back. Users can scan these QR codes using the mobile app, and the web app will read out the tile's description to them. This feature is incredibly useful for individuals who may not be able to read the tile themselves.

Additionally, users can learn about the point system associated with specific Mah Jong patterns. By tapping the microphone button, the web app will provide an audible explanation of the point system. A restart button is available to stop the speaker from reciting the point system.
